# NLP-Project-Build-Spam-Ham-Classifier-Application
## Objective
Classify texts into spam and ham (not spam) categories using NLP and machine learning.

## Key NLP Concepts
- Tokenization
- Parts of speech tagging
- Word embeddings (word2vec)
- TF-IDF vectors

## Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- LightGBM
- Random Forest
- Pipelines

## Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory data analysis with matplotlib
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Generating word embeddings
- Applying machine learning classification models
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Using pipelines for Workflow

## Key Results
- TF-IDF feature extraction outperformed word2vec embeddings
- Random Forest with TF-IDF had 95% accuracy
- SVM and LightGBM also performed well with TF-IDF features
